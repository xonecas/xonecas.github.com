                    Last time I was in Brazil, things got a little out of hand during a "misunderstanding" about the market prices of the neighboring country's favorite "export". Like is often to happen in these adventures; the local "merchants" felt disrespected and we were "urged" to repay our transgression through a series of PHP exercises and other buzzwordy sounding IT challenges...but in Portuguese. Luckily I wasn't dumb enough to travel to Brazil without Sean Caetano Martin. With his help, (let's be honest I just looked pretty) we coded our way out of this mess and into the hearts of the local "merchant's" daughter. The "merchants" were very impressed with our (read Sean's) skills, but could not let his daughter go without formally challenging us to a martial arts showdown. At Sunset we pitted Sean's Kung Fu and my looking pretty against the "merchant's" capoeira. Needless to say, Sean's Kung Fu prevailed where my moderate looks failed. We all celebrated together with the "Merchant" and his daughter and enjoyed caipirinas till sunrise. (Sean never slept)
