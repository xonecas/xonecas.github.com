Day One.
--------

Palo ALto, May 15 2013

I had a really stressful weekend. I smoked a lot of cigarettes. I ate a lot of *quick*, unhealthy food.

As I smoked my last ciggie last night, which is usually the best one for me. I figured out half way through it that it was tasting terrible. I slowly regressed in my mind to try to remember the last cigarette that I truly enjoyed. I can't, its a guess but I think right after the last time I has **CENSORED**.

I quickly put out that cigarette and proclaimed "I am done.". I really am, it might be a rough set of weeks and months ahead of me, but never before (on my many attempts at this) have I ever done it because I wanted it for myself.

So for day one, I started by waking up early, exercising and getting to work early. Why? Well lets think that through. I never really smoke during the day, it's after work that I usually crave it. With an early start, exercise and a long day at work it's almost guaranteed that I'll be too tired tonight to even think about anything other than my bed.

That is the general plan. Along with that, is calorie counting and watching what I eat. I have learned from my previous attempts that I always get morbidly fat when I try to kick nicotine out.

I'm not going to be too strict on what I eat, the basic idea is no junk food, and small portions. That should be good enough to keep me from swelling like a land wale (LOL)

Wish me luck!
