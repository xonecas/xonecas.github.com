title: CreativeJS - Three.js Tutorial
---

I completed [this](http://creativejs.com/tutorials/three-js-part-1-make-a-star-field/) tutorial.  At the end of the tutorial Seb challenges everyone to do some exercises (homework): change the direction, shape, color and angle of the particles.

For a deeper look on what is going on there, check out the [Github repo](https://github.com/xonecas/creativejs-threejs-part1). The evolution of the code is neatly organized with (git) tags.
