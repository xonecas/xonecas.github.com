Experimenting with HTML canvas
------------------------------

Sunnyvale, Feb 28, 2013

A while ago I got curious about the canvas element, so I made myself a playground. I dug it up searching for a utility function I wrote somewhere (still to be found, but that is another story). Turns out it still works, and it is actually fun to play through. You can see the full blown thing [here](http://xonecas.github.com/2d-particle-experiements/) or use the `iframe` bellow.
