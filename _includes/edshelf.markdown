#### Full stack engineer / architech

At edshelf I was brought in to satisfy the need to have a full stack engineer, fit to work with both nodejs and client side technologies. Since then we have build a performant node server based on the express framework and a complete user interface based on [ Twitter's Bootstrap ](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/index.html) and [ Yahoo!'s YUI3 ](http://yuilibrary.com/projects/yui3/).
