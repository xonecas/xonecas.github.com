He is not a backend engineer, he is full stack. After starting with mIRC Scripts at a young age he knew that coding was awesome, and that was all that it took. After years in college with Java and C Sean got a job writting Javascript in a browser enviroment. It's been almost 5 years since that day, now Sean is an outstanding developer with a great background in web development.
